Sure, here's the exercise you described written in Markdown language:

## Exercise: Creating a Blogging Platform with Filtering

### App 1: Blog
1. Create a new Django app named `Blog`.
2. In the `models.py` file of the `Blog` app, define a model `Post` with the following fields:
   - `title`
   - `content`
   - `pub_date`
   - `author` (foreign key to the Author model)

3. Create a `filters.py` file in the `Blog` app.
4. Define a `PostFilter` class that inherits from `django_filters.FilterSet`.
5. Add filters for:
   - `title`
   - `pub_date`
   - `author`

### App 2: Author
1. Create another Django app named `Author`.
2. In the `models.py` file of the `Author` app, define a model `Author` with the following fields:
   - `first_name`
   - `last_name`
   - `email`

### Project Configuration
1. Add both the `Blog` and `Author` apps to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in your project's settings.
2. Configure the `urls.py` file of the `Blog` app to include necessary URL routes for listing and filtering posts.
3. In the views of the `Blog` app, use the `DjangoFilterBackend` with the `filterset_class` attribute to apply the `PostFilter` class for filtering the list of posts.
4. Create appropriate templates and views to display the list of filtered posts.

### Exercise Tasks
1. Create the models `Post` and `Author` with necessary fields in their respective apps.
2. Define the `PostFilter` class in the `filters.py` of the `Blog` app, including filters for title, pub_date, and author.
3. Configure the views in the `Blog` app to display a list of posts with the filters applied.
4. Test the filtering functionality by applying different filters (e.g., filtering by title, filtering by author, etc.).

### Bonus
Implement a search functionality that allows users to search for posts based on specific keywords.

By completing this exercise, you'll have a working blogging platform with filtering capabilities and the ability to search for posts. This exercise helps you practice creating models, filters, views, and templates within the Django framework
